    "A statistical test was conducted to determine if the average weekly operating cost for restaurants deviates from the theoretical value of Rs. 4,000. The results of the test indicate a significant difference between the observed average cost and the expected cost. Specifically, the actual average cost is substantially lower than the theoretical prediction. This suggests that the underlying assumptions used to calculate the theoretical cost may not be accurate or that there are factors influencing the actual costs that were not accounted for in the theoretical model."
